This is a web scraping project consisting of 2 scripts in python and PHP. 
The python program periodically downloads and extracts the information about 
the most active stocks on NYSE (The New York Stock Exchange), and saves/updates 
the information into a database. We then implemented a PHP script that can generate 
web pages to serve the information through a web server upon user requests. The 
database used for this project is MongoDB. In the python program, beautifulsoup 
is used to parse the HTML documents. After inspecting https://finance.yahoo.com/most-active,
we are able to locate the  the following 5 fields and insert into the database: 
Symbol, Name, Price (Introday), Change, and Volume.
Using the contents method provided by beautifulsoup to split the html documents into 
an arra, we can locate the specific information we are looking for and grabbing
only the text. We this information we are able to create a JSON-like document and 
save into our database using pymongo. This is all done in an ifinite loop and we update
our database every 3 minutes. We send requests to the website and ensure it is a 
successful connection (status_code = 200). We are able to confirm the efficiency of 
our program and check the database using MongoDB compass. In our PHP script, we read the data out 
from the database and create the HTML page generated by the PHP script. The PHP script 
connects to and queries our mongodb database to obtain the data saved earlier
by the python program. With the data, it generates a web page containing a table. 
The table allows users to sort the data by clicking the column title on the header row.
We create href link on every header column and sorted the the data directly from MongoDB
accordingly.
